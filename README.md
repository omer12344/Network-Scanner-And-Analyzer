Our project comprises a comprehensive suite of tools designed for network scanning and packet sniffing. Utilizing the Python programming language and leveraging libraries such as Scapy and Netifaces, it offers functionalities for discovering devices on a local network, identifying open ports and services, and analyzing network traffic to detect potential security threats. The results of scans and analyses are conveniently sent to specified email addresses, providing users with detailed reports on their network's status and security posture.

Features
- Network Scanning: Detects active IP addresses within the local network through ICMP pings.
- Port Scanning: Checks for open ports on discovered IP addresses to infer running services.
- Service Identification: Maps open ports to standard services (e.g., HTTP, SSH) to identify what is running on each IP address.
- Packet Sniffing: Captures packets traversing the network, filtering and analyzing them based on protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.).
- Protocol Statistics: Generates statistics on the usage of different network protocols.
- Security Threat Detection: Identifies potential security threats based on analysis of network traffic patterns.
- Email Reporting: Sends detailed reports of scan results and security assessments via email.
